There are six particle types: electron, proton, muon, kaon, pion and ghost. 
Ghost is a particle with other type than the first five or a detector noise.
Different particle types remain different responses in the detector systems or subdetectors. 
Thre are five systems: tracking system, ring imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH), electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters, and muon system. The task of the model is to identify a particle type using the responses in the detector systems.
